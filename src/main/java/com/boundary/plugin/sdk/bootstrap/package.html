<h1>Download Plugin Jar</h1>
<p>Utility for bootstrapping a java plugin</p>
<p>Git repositories store all versions of files and in the case of java plugins we are including a single 
jar file <code>plugin.jar</code> which includes all dependencies. Every new version of the plugin will grow
100% more. To avoid this we download the plugin from a GitHub release.
